# NOTE: Data include unclassified graduate students. Data through 1995 are for institutions of higher education, while later data are for degree-granting institutions. Degree-granting institutions grant associate’s or higher degrees and participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs. The degree-granting classification is very similar to the earlier higher education classification, but it includes more 2-year colleges and excludes a few higher education institutions that did not grant degrees. Some data have been revised from previously published figures.

**Figure 1. Graduate strudent enrollment by year from 1967 to 2015.** Fall enrollment of female and male students each year from 1967 to 2015.  *SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS), "Fall Enrollment in Colleges and Universities" surveys, 1967 through 1985; Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), "Fall Enrollment Survey" (IPEDS-EF:86-99); IPEDS Spring 2001 through Spring 2016, Fall Enrollment component. Prepared February 2017.*	

Graduate enrollment of female students is significantly predicted by year (*b* = 30126, t(`r pearsonsr_f_enrollment_year$parameter`) = `r round(pearsonsr_f_enrollment_year$statistic,2)`, *p* < 0.001) with a strong positive correlation between the two (Pearson's *r* = `r round(pearsonsr_f_enrollment_year$estimate,2)`. The model (*enrolled students* = 30126(*Year*) - 58955502) explains a significant amount of variance in female graduate student enrollment (F(1,47) = 2669, *p* < 0.001, $R^2$ = 0.98).

Similarly, the model (*enrolled students* = 9069(*Year*) - 17112153) explains a significant amount of variance in male graduate student enrollment (F(1,47) = 276, *p* < 0.001, $R^2$ = 0.85). Graduate enrollment of male students is also significantly predicted by year (*b* = 9069, t(`r pearsonsr_m_enrollment_year$parameter`) = `r round(pearsonsr_m_enrollment_year$statistic,2)`, *p* < 0.001) with a strong positive correlation between the two (Pearson's *r* = `r round(pearsonsr_m_enrollment_year$estimate,2)`.

Graduate enrollment generally increased for both male and female students from 1967 to 2015, though enrollment of female graduate students increased faster than enrollment of male students. In 1967 women comprised 29.6% of all enrolled graduate students. The sex ratio of graduate students switched from to male-biased to female biased in 1988 when the percentage of female students increased from 49.8% of all students in 1987 to 50.3% in 1988. By 2015, 58.5% of graduate students were female.  In recent years, enrollment leveled and even decreased slightly staring in 2010 following the 2008/2009 financial crisis.
