Part 2: Is there a significant shift in female PhD recipients across four fields (Physical & Earth Sciences, Engineering, Education, and Humanities & Arts) across 15-year intervals from 1985, 2000, and 2015? 

```{r}

library(stargazer)
library(kableExtra)

```{r}
# Reading in .csv datasets and performing exploratory analyses on the data

fem_phd = read_csv("female_phd_by_field.csv")

# cursory glance indicates there is a increase in female PhD recipients in all four fields in 1985, 2000, and 2015. But are these increases statistically significant?

# creating a new df with just the percentages
